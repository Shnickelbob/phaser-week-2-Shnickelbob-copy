## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 0/20 off late points

## Self-Reflection:
game was quite difficult to make. It wouldn't work the way the youtube tutorial said to make it. Using old version of Phaser (I think) and put everything in index.html which I think caused problems. After taking a break to work on the final I came back and finished in a timely manner

### How long it took me to finish this?
probably about 3 hrs
